|         PATCH          |                     DESCRIPTION                     |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| arrowkeys_normal.patch | Adds arrows keys support in normal mode.            |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| longbuf.patch          | Overcome 2GB buffer size limitations. Fix all warns |
|                        | Will be able to read very large files.              |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| threaded_search.patch  | Multithreaded version of lbuf_search(). Adjust the  |
|                        | number of threads in use and buffer stepping in     |
|                        | lbuf.c Ensure that your system supports posix       |
|                        | threads, aka libpthread                             |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| colors_lnum.patch      | Demonstrates the most simple way one could go about |
|                        | customizing colors for linenumbers triggered by #   |
|                        | keybind without breaking existing syntax highlights |
|                        | on the c filetype. More complicated approach can be |
|                        | to use syn_addhl() and a NULL pattern, however that |
|                        | requires more modifications.                        |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| hl_part.patch          | Allow syntax highlight to continue past the terminal|
|                        | dimensions up to a certain limit.                   |
|                        | To customize the depth, adjust LEDFORW and LEDBACK  |
|                        | definitions in led.c                                |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| hl_naive.patch         | Original approach to syntax highlight as in neatvi. |
|                        |                                                     |
|                        | Pros:                                               |
|                        | 1. simpler and shorter code in led_render()         |
|                        | 2. unlimited length, can highlight anything         |
|                        | pikevm is willing to match.                         |
|                        | 3. retains correct right to left highlight if option|
|                        | order=0 and td=-2 are set. Base nextvi will always  |
|                        | highlight left to right, unless the line does not   |
|                        | extend past the terminal.                           |
|                        | 4. Requires a bit less amount of memory to run.     |
|                        |                                                     |
|                        | Cons:                                               |
|                        | 1. Terrible performance, need to disable syntax hl  |
|                        | if working with lines 10K+ (You've been warned!)    |
|                        | 2. Cannot render lines like those by option pac=1   |
|                        | efficiently. Will recompute the whole string every  |
|                        | iteration.                                          |
|                        | 3. Difficult to adapt other kinds of codes to make  |
|                        | use of.                                             |
|                        |                                                     |
|                        | Patch is not compatible with hl_part.patch in any   |
|                        | way, pick one or the other.                         |
